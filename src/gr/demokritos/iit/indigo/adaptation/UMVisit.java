<p>Description:
* This interface specifying the API between the Natular-OWL (the Natural-Language-Machine of A.U.E.B.) and the Personalization-Server.
* The Personalization-Server is a system that parses and processes the contents of the UserModeling.rdf file  (which is a file that 
* the Authoring tool exports) and then stores the information into a DataBase. These files contain information which is about the user
* modeling. More specifically these files have the following information:
* 	
* 	-information about the User-Type for each user-type(adult,chid,group), the max facts
* 	per sentence, the max fact per page and the type of synthesizer(male,female,child).
* 	
* 	-information about the Properties-Interest for each user-type, how interest every
* 	property in the ontology is.
* 	
* 	-information about the Properties-Repetitions for each user-type, how many times
* 	each property should the machine talk about.(e.g If for property "has-age" the 
* 	repetion-number is 2, the machine can use at most two times that property,
* 	in order to produce text)
* 	
* 	-information about the Appropriateness of Microplans for each user-type, how
* 	appropriate is each microplan.
* 	
* 	-information about the Class-Interest for each user-type, how interest is to
* 	mention in the produced text for the X instance, that is type-of class (e.g.
* 	for the instance "building_1", to mention that "...building1 is a building..."
* 	
* 	-information about the Class-Repetion for each user-type, how many times can mention
* 	in the produced text that Instance-X is type-of Class-Y.
* 	
* 
* The following interface are the functions of the API between the Personalization-Server and the Natural-OWL machine.
