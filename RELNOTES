5 Mar 2009, Version 1.1

This version mostly sees a major code refactoring, separating GUI from
core functionality. It also includes the following fixes:
 * Extends user models to generic generation profiles. 
 * Complete URIs are preserved and not only local names. Entities with
   foreign URIs (different prefix than current base) cannot be edited,
   but are treated as imported vocabularies.
 * Entity names are case-sensitively compared.
 * Having as domain the union of named classes, makes a property
   appear on the panel of all classes in the union.
 * Upon importing an rdf:Property, ELEON tries to infer whether it is
   a datatype or an object property from rdf:range triples and from fillers
   in existing triples of this property.
 * Greek language strings have been converted to UTF-8.
