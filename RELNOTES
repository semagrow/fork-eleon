Planned changes for ELEON v2:
 - finalize the DL inference pipeline, making everything properties-configurable
 - implement an OntoExtension object that interfaces with Pellet   
 - extend to pipelines for preference and ling annotations
 - remove the fixed filenames for annotations, and implement a mechanism
   (possibly based on owl:import) for remembering the links between OWL files
   and RDF annotations.
 - Make it possible to re-combine annotations and ontologies.
 - Factor UI strings out of the code and use standard localization mechanisms.   
 
 And beyond:
 - Remove the distinction between user and system models and develop an RDF
   schema for describing stereotype features.
 - Separate stereotype features from preference profiles.
 - Develop a mechanism for attribute vocabularies (besides interest) and
   registries of tools that understand each term.
 - Design a new RDF vocabulary for annotations, transformable back to owlnl:
   among others: allow for filler regranulation (e.g. say the 19th c. instead of 1821)
   depending on the importance of a specific date and the user type (e.g. experts get
   exact dates)
 - Initialize from rdf:label and abstract names, assuming classes are nouns and
   properties are verbs


Jun 2009, Version 2.0-beta01

Defines a mechanism for external inference components:
 * Defines the OntoExtension interface of components that complete the ontology model
 * Collects all the various OWL axioms that previous ELEON versions implemented into
   the .struct.MicroReasoner class, which implements OntoExtension
 
Other:
 * Upgrades to Jena 2.6.0, and replaces ELEON code using deprecated Jena calls.
 * Fixes filename and namespace errors between ELEON and NaturalOWL.   
 * build.xml creates executable jar


5 Mar 2009, Version 1.1

This version mostly sees a major code refactoring, separating GUI from
core functionality. It also includes the following fixes:
 * Extends user models to generic generation profiles. 
 * Complete URIs are preserved and not only local names. Entities with
   foreign URIs (different prefix than current base) cannot be edited,
   but are treated as imported vocabularies.
 * Entity names are case-sensitively compared.
 * Having as domain the union of named classes, makes a property
   appear on the panel of all classes in the union.
 * Upon importing an rdf:Property, ELEON tries to infer whether it is
   a datatype or an object property from rdf:range triples and from fillers
   in existing triples of this property.
 * Greek language strings have been converted to UTF-8.
   

10 Jun 2008, Version 1.0

The first public release of ELEON.
Main points of ELEON functionality:
 * Create for scratch or import OWL ontologies
 * Annotate OWL ontologies with linguistic elements (nouns, verbs,
   microplans)
 * Create user models
 * Connect to Natural Language Generation Engines to generate previews
 * Connect to Description Logic inference engines for ontology
   checking
 * Connect to relational databases for retrieving ontology instances
 * Supports English, Greek and Italian
